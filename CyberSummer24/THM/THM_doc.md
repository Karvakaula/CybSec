## Introduction to cyber security

During this path i got a good overview of cybersecurity as a career and possiblities it can provide.
Also gave a good introduction to offensive and defensive security and what they might include.

## Pre security

A great path before diving deeper into cyber security as it gave a change to bring back some forgotten knowledge, most of the stuf on this path i already knew but it doesnt hurt to go over the basics as they are the foundation of everything.
