## Projects

### Hacking challenges

- **Vulnhub-Pwnlab**: Did a hacking challenge as a part of cyber security course and documented it (link to doc here)
- **Badstore**: Pretty easy hacking challenge as a part of cyber security course. (link here)

### Project 1: Tukko 2.0, web application security

(link to documentation)

- **Description**: as a part of FutureFactory2024 we were given the task to improve Tukko traffic visualizer app by implementing features, our team decided to improte its security.
- **Technologies**: Mern stack, docker, Js libraries
- **What was done**:
  - HTTPS connection, by acquiring ssl certificate for the domain with letsencrypt and configuring the applications frontend and backend to use HTTPS protocol.
  - Api endpoint securing by api ratelimiting using tockenbucket and ip ratelimit methods, security headers using helmet js library, input validation
  - Secure user authentication, express-session management, input validation, password hashing using Bcrypt.
- **Documentation**
